## Transmitter Coil – Practical Working

The transmitter coil is placed on the charging pad or ground side and is connected to the inverter output.

“The transmitter coil converts high-frequency electrical energy into magnetic energy.”

### Electrical Input to Transmitter Coil
- Type: High-frequency AC
- Source: Inverter (DC to AC conversion)
- Frequency: Few kHz to tens of kHz
- Voltage: Typically 12–24 V AC (prototype level)

### Working Principle
When high-frequency AC current flows through the transmitter coil:
1. Current continuously changes direction
2. A time-varying magnetic field is generated around the coil
3. Magnetic field expands and collapses with AC waveform

This alternating magnetic field carries energy through air without any physical contact.

### Key Design Factors
- Number of turns of the coil
- Diameter of the coil
- Input current magnitude
- Operating frequency

Higher frequency and proper coil design improve magnetic coupling.

### Important Observation
The transmitter coil does not transfer electrical current directly to the receiver.  
Only magnetic energy is transferred.

### Practical Limitation
Because air is used as the medium instead of a magnetic core, a significant portion of magnetic flux is lost, reducing efficiency.
