## Battery – Energy Storage Mechanism

The battery stores electrical energy in chemical form. During charging, electrical energy forces chemical reactions inside the battery. During discharging, these reactions reverse and supply DC power.

### Role in This Project
- Acts as an energy buffer and get the power from solar panel then pass it to the EV's battery through coils.
- Provides stable input voltage to the inverter
- Allows charging even when sunlight is unavailable. Charging is possible without sunlight because the battery stores solar energy earlier and supplies power later.
- Stores solar energy during sunlight hours
- Supplies DC power when sunlight is unavailable
