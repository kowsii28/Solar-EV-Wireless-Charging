## Battery – Energy Storage Mechanism

The battery stores electrical energy in chemical form. During charging, electrical energy forces chemical reactions inside the battery. During discharging, these reactions reverse and supply DC power.

### Role in This Project
- Acts as an energy buffer
- Provides stable power to the inverter
- Allows charging even when sunlight is unavailable

### Typical Battery Behavior
- Fully charged: ~12.6 V
- Nominal: ~12 V
- Discharged: ~11 V
