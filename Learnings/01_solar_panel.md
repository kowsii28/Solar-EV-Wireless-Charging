## Solar Panel – Practical Working

Sunlight consists of photons. When photons strike the silicon PN junction of the solar cell, they transfer energy to electrons and free them from atomic bonds.

The internal electric field of the PN junction forces these free electrons to move in one direction, producing DC voltage and current. This process is known as the **photovoltaic effect**.



### Practical Output
- Output Type: DC (constant voltage producing unidirectional current)
- Voltage: 12–18 V (varies with sunlight)
- Nature: Unstable

Because the output fluctuates, the energy is not used directly and is stored in a battery.
