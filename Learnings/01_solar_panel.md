## Solar Panel – Practical Working

Sunlight consists of photons. When photons strike the silicon PN junction of the solar cell, they transfer energy to electrons and free them from atomic bonds.

The internal electric field of the PN junction forces these free electrons to move in one direction, producing DC voltage and current. This process is known as the **photovoltaic effect**.

### Solar Panel Used in This Project

A small **polycrystalline silicon solar panel** was used to generate DC power for the prototype. Polycrystalline panels were chosen due to their availability, robustness, and suitability for academic demonstration.

Typical characteristics:
- Nature: Unstable
- Power Rating: 5–20 W (prototype level)
- Rated Voltage: 12–18 V (varies with sunlight)
- Output Type: DC  (constant voltage producing unidirectional current)
- Usage: Battery charging and power support for wireless charging system

Because the output fluctuates, the energy is not used directly and is stored in a battery.
