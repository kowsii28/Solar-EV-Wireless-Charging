## Inverter – DC to AC Conversion

Wireless power transfer requires a changing magnetic field, which cannot be produced by DC. Therefore, an inverter is used.

### Working Principle
- DC from battery is switched rapidly using MOSFETs
- Switching produces high-frequency AC (square wave)
- High frequency improves magnetic coupling

### Output
- Type: AC
- Frequency: Few kHz to tens of kHz
