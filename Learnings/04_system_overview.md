## Wireless Power Transfer – System Overview

Wireless power transfer in this project is based on electromagnetic induction.

Electrical energy is converted into magnetic energy at the transmitter side and then converted back into electrical energy at the receiver side.

The system consists of:
- A transmitter coil connected to a high-frequency AC source
- A receiver coil mounted on the vehicle
- Power conditioning circuits on the receiver side

The overall behavior is similar to a transformer without a magnetic core, resulting in loose coupling and reduced efficiency.
