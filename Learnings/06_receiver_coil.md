## Receiver Coil – Practical Working

The receiver coil is mounted on the vehicle and positioned close to the transmitter coil.

“The receiver coil converts magnetic energy back into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction.”

### Magnetic Coupling
When the alternating magnetic field generated by the transmitter coil passes through the receiver coil:
- The magnetic flux links with the receiver coil
- According to Faraday’s law, a voltage is induced

This induced voltage is alternating in nature and has the same frequency as the transmitter.

### Electrical Output from Receiver Coil
- Type: AC
- Frequency: Same as transmitter
- Voltage: Lower than transmitter (depends on alignment and distance)

### Power Processing on Receiver Side
The induced AC voltage is not directly suitable for battery charging. Therefore:
1. Rectifier converts AC to DC
2. Filter smoothens the DC output
3. Voltage regulator ensures safe charging voltage
4. Battery stores the energy

### Key Factors Affecting Output
- Distance between coils
- Coil alignment
- Coil size and shape
- Operating frequency

### Important Note
Charging occurs only when the vehicle is stationary and coils are properly aligned.

Dynamic charging while the vehicle is moving is not implemented in this project.
