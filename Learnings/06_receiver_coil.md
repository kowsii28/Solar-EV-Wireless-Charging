## Receiver Coil – Practical Working

The receiver coil is mounted on the vehicle and positioned close to the transmitter coil.

“The receiver coil converts magnetic energy back into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction.”

- A changing magnetic field can create an electric voltage in a conductor.

- Transmitter coil → carrying high-frequency AC

- AC current → creates a changing magnetic field

- Receiver coil → placed nearby

Now:

1. Magnetic field expands and collapses

2. Magnetic field cuts across the receiver coil

3. Electrons in receiver coil feel a force

4. Electrons start moving

5. That movement creates voltage

### Magnetic Coupling
When the alternating magnetic field generated by the transmitter coil passes through the receiver coil:
- The magnetic flux links with the receiver coil
- According to Faraday’s law, a voltage is induced

### Understanding Magnetic Flux and Faraday’s Law

#### 🔹 Magnetic Flux
- Magnetic flux can be understood as the **number of magnetic field lines passing through the receiver coil**
- More magnetic field lines passing through the coil → **higher magnetic flux**

#### 🔹 Change of Flux
- Magnetic flux must **change with time** to induce voltage
- A constant (unchanging) magnetic field does **not** induce voltage
- Faster change in magnetic flux → **higher induced voltage**

#### 🔹 Rate of Change of Flux
- High-frequency AC in the transmitter coil causes a **rapid change in magnetic flux**
- Rapid change in magnetic flux → **higher induced voltage in the receiver coil**

📌 This is why a **high-frequency inverter** is used in the system to improve wireless power transfer efficiency.
 
This induced voltage is alternating in nature and has the same frequency as the transmitter.

### Electrical Output from Receiver Coil
- Type: AC
- Frequency: Same as transmitter
- Voltage: Lower than transmitter (depends on alignment and distance)

### Power Processing on Receiver Side
The induced AC voltage is not directly suitable for battery charging. Therefore:
1. Rectifier converts AC to DC
2. Filter smoothens the DC output
3. Voltage regulator ensures safe charging voltage
4. Battery stores the energy

### Key Factors Affecting Output
- Distance between coils
- Coil alignment
- Coil size and shape
- Operating frequency

### Important Note
Charging occurs only when the vehicle is stationary and coils are properly aligned.

Dynamic charging while the vehicle is moving is not implemented in this project.
